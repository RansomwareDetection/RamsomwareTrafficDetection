This project focuses on developing a real-time ransomware detection system by 
integrating deep learning models with SSL visibility devices for comprehensive 
network traffic analysis. The solution involves using Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to analyze decrypted 
network traffic data for detecting ransomware activities. SSL visibility devices 
will decrypt encrypted traffic, allowing the deep learning models to inspect and 
analyze detailed network behaviors and anomalies. CNNs will extract feature 
patterns from the traffic data, while GRUs will handle temporal dependencies 
and sequences, enhancing the system's ability to identify sophisticated 
ransomware threats.Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM) will be 
integrated to provide contextual analysis, generate human-readable 
explanations, and adaptively refine the detection models based on evolving 
threat intelligence. The real-time detection capability will provide immediate 
alerts and responses, ensuring robust protection against evolving ransomware 
attacks.
