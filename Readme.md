Problem Statement:

This project focuses on developing a real-time ransomware detection system by integrating deep learning models with SSL visibility devices for comprehensive network traffic analysis. The solution involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to analyze decrypted network traffic data for detecting ransomware activities. SSL visibility devices will decrypt encrypted traffic, allowing the deep learning models to inspect and analyze detailed network behaviors and anomalies. CNNs will extract feature patterns from the traffic data, while GRUs will handle temporal dependencies and sequences, enhancing the system's ability to identify sophisticated ransomware threats.Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM) will be integrated to provide contextual analysis, generate human-readable explanations, and adaptively refine the detection models based on evolving threat intelligence. The real-time detection capability will provide immediate alerts and responses, ensuring robust protection against evolving ransomware attacks.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **real-time ransomware detection system** by integrating deep learning models with SSL visibility devices to analyze network traffic. The goal is to provide an advanced security solution capable of detecting ransomware activity hidden within encrypted traffic.

The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)** for network traffic analysis. CNNs are used for extracting key feature patterns from decrypted traffic data, while GRUs are responsible for handling temporal dependencies and sequence analysis. This dual approach improves the detection of sophisticated ransomware threats that may evolve over time.

Additionally, a **Large Language Model (LLM)** is incorporated to provide contextual analysis, generate human-readable insights, and continuously refine the detection system based on new threat intelligence.

## Key Features

- **SSL Visibility Integration:** The system works in tandem with SSL visibility devices that decrypt encrypted traffic, enabling the inspection of otherwise hidden network behaviors.
  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Combines CNNs and GRUs to accurately analyze traffic patterns and detect ransomware activity with high precision.
  
- **Contextual Analysis with LLM:** The LLM enhances the detection model by providing explanations for detections and refining the model using new and evolving ransomware threats.
  
- **Real-Time Detection and Response:** Immediate alerts and automated responses ensure quick action to neutralize ransomware attacks in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Models:** TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- **Neural Networks:** CNNs for feature extraction, GRUs for handling temporal dependencies
- **SSL Visibility Devices:** For decrypting network traffic
- **Large Language Model (LLM):** For contextual threat analysis and model refinement

## How It Works

1. **Traffic Decryption:** SSL visibility devices decrypt encrypted network traffic, making it available for deep analysis.
2. **CNNs for Feature Extraction:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) extract relevant features from network traffic, such as packet size, timing, and anomaly patterns.
3. **GRUs for Temporal Analysis:** Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) process sequential data to capture the temporal dependencies, enabling the detection of ransomware activity over time.
4. **LLM for Contextual Analysis:** The Large Language Model provides insights, interprets threat patterns, and helps refine the detection model with the latest threat intelligence.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Security:** Protect corporate networks from ransomware hidden in encrypted traffic.
- **Financial Institutions:** Safeguard sensitive financial data against sophisticated ransomware attacks.
- **Government Networks:** Ensure the protection of sensitive government systems with real-time, adaptive ransomware detection.
